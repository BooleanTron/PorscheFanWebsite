            Porsche was deeply involved in vehicle engineering for the Nazis during World War II. Ferdinand Porsche designed multiple military vehicles, including the Kübelwagen, Schwimmwagen, and tanks like the Elefant (previously mentioned). Volkswagen, a government-funded company at the time, commissioned Porsche to develop a civilian car – the Volkswagen Beetle. The success of these projects funded the early days of Porsche’s engineering firm.
           <br> <strong>Type 64 (1939)</strong> 
Engine: 1.0-liter flat-four, 50 hp.
Top Speed: 88 mph.
Significance: The Type 64 is the very first car to bear the Porsche name. Developed by Ferdinand Porsche for the Berlin-Rome race, this streamlined car laid the groundwork for the 356 and the later models.
